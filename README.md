# Karatsuba Multiplier

This repository contains a digital system design project focused on implementing the Karatsuba multiplier algorithm. The project aims to design a hardware module capable of performing fast multiplication of two binary numbers using the Karatsuba algorithm.

## Contents

The repository includes the following files:

- `karatsuba.vhd`: VHDL source code for the Karatsuba multiplier module.
- `testbench.vhd`: VHDL testbench code for simulating and verifying the functionality of the multiplier module.

## Getting Started

To use or modify the Karatsuba multiplier module, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

2. Open the VHDL source code file `karatsuba.vhd` in your preferred development environment.

3. Modify the source code as needed or use it as a reference for your own project.

4. Compile and simulate the design using the provided `Makefile`:

5. Review the simulation results and verify the correctness of the Karatsuba multiplier module.
